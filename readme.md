## Setup
1. Install Python
2. Install VSCode
3. VS code live share
3. Quick test

## The Basics
1. Writing and running a 'hello world' python script
2. basic data types - strings, int, floats
3. python comments
4. exercise: do some math
5. variables
6. user input and prints
7. exercise: ask user for their names, tell them that they're awesome! or ask them for some numbers and do some calculations
8. booleans and operators: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp
9. exercise: ask user for numbers and ask if they wish to add, substract, multiply or divide them, then print result
10. conditionals with python indendation
11. for & while loop (range & len operators)
12. exercise: print user's name 10 times
13. lists, set, dictionaries
14. exercise: update properties of a dictionary. print contents of an array
15. python help methods and how to run python commands via terminal
16. functions
17. variable scopes
18. exercise: breakdown some of the above code into functions
19. exercise/mini project: Guess the number game + how to break down requirements

## Beyond Basics
1. intro to pip
2. modules and imports in python
3. exercise: use python's math module to do some advanced calculations
4. python requests module and how to call APIs
5. install postman and try a few APIs from here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
6. exercise: get dad jokes and print them out. API: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api
7. send email from python. reference: https://realpython.com/python-send-email/
8. exercise: email dad jokes to yourself
9. sending text or whatsapp messages from python. reference: https://www.twilio.com/
10. exercise: text/whatsapp dad jokes to yourself


## Advanced
1. exercise/project: Integrate dadjoke code with heroku. text/email yourself dad jokes every hour on a schedule (https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/schedule-a-python-script-on-heroku-a978b2f91ca8)
2. OOP (mainly classes and using them)
3. exercise: replace some dictionaries from before with classes
4. git & github integration
5. exercise: check in your code to a github repo
6. Flask and how to build APIs
7. exercise: build an API to get dadjokes from your app. expose API via heroku, to get dad jokes whenever you feel like. 
8. challenge exercise (optional): Integrate the API created before with a chatbot. Ask the bot to get you dadjokes
9. pygame (optional)

## A few project ideas
1. Extract candidate info from resume(PDF) and store it in excel, from where you can sort by skills, experience etc
2. Extract candidate info from resume and compare it with job listings. Match candidates with the ideal listings for them, matching skillset, experience etc
3. create a GUI for the above app using pygame
4. Integrate above project with a chatbot (messenger, whatsapp or any other) or put it as a website. You simply upload the resume there and it gives you recommended listings

In order to do some of the projects above, you would need to learn how to deal with PDFs and excels and files in general in python
